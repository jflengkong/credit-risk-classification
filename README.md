## Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Part : Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets 


## Part : Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
